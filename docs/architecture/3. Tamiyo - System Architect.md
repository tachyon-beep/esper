# **Technical Specification: Tamiyo, The Seed Controller**

**Version:** 0.1a
**Status:** Drafting
**Date:** 23 June 2025
**Author:** John Morrissey, Gemini AI

## **1. Overview and Mandate**

### **1.1. Role in the Morphogenetic Ecosystem**

In the morphogenetic architecture, agents are separated by function to ensure clarity and modularity.

* **Tamiyo**: The **Controller**. Tamiyo is the strategic decision-making agent. She observes the state of the entire network, analyzes telemetry from the seed lattice, and uses a defined policy to decide **if**, **when**, and **which** seed should germinate and what blueprint to use.

This document specifies the architecture and logic of the Tamiyo controller.

### **1.2. Design Philosophy**

The Tamiyo controller is designed to be a pluggable policy module. Version 1.0 implements a robust, configurable set of heuristics. Future versions will replace these heuristics with a trained neural network, allowing Tamiyo to learn sophisticated germination policies from experience. The interface specified here is designed to support both implementations without requiring changes to the surrounding system.

## **2. Telemetry: The Controller's Senses**

To make informed decisions, Tamiyo requires a continuous stream of telemetry from the seed lattice. This information is pushed from the seeds to Tamiyo at the end of each training epoch.

### **2.1. Global System Metrics**

This is high-level information about the overall performance of the host network.

* **current_epoch (int)**: The current training epoch number.  
* **validation_accuracy (float)**: The primary performance metric on a held-out validation set.  
* validation_loss **(float)**: The secondary performance metric.

### **2.2. Seed Lattice Telemetry (Per-Seed/Chunk)**

This is fine-grained information about the health and status of each individual seed location (chunk). As defined in the Kasmina operator specification, each `KasminaSeed` proactively calculates and **pushes** a health report at the end of every training epoch. These reports are sent to a central event bus or data store that Tamiyo subscribes to. This push-based architecture ensures Tamiyo has a complete, real-time health map of the network without needing to query each seed individually.

The health signal from each seed contains:

* **seed_id (tuple)**: The unique coordinate (layer_idx, seed_idx) of the reporting seed.
* **chunk_health_signal (dict)**: A dictionary of diagnostic metrics describing the health of the associated neuron chunk. This includes:
  * `chunk_variance`: The primary signal for detecting stagnant or "dead" chunks.
  * `avg_inter_node_correlation`: A measure of functional redundancy within the chunk.
  * `dead_node_ratio`: The proportion of inactive neurons within the chunk.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class SystemStatePacket:
"""A snapshot of the entire system's state for a given epoch, consumed by Tamiyo."""

# Global metrics from the main training loop
current_epoch: int
validation_accuracy: float
validation_loss: float

# Hardware context for the current environment
hardware_context: HardwareContext

# Seed health data, populated from the push-based telemetry stream
seed_health_map: dict[tuple[int, int], dict] = field(default_factory=dict)
# Seed lifecycle states, also updated from seed reports
seed_state_map: dict[tuple[int, int], str] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

### **2.4. Canonical Seed Lifecycle**

To ensure consistency with the Kasmina architecture, the Tamiyo controller uses a canonical seed lifecycle that defines the states and transitions of seeds within the system. This lifecycle is critical for maintaining a shared understanding of seed states across all components, preventing

The authoritative definition of the seed lifecycle can be found in Section 9 of the Kasmina detailed design document, which provides a comprehensive overview of the lifecycle stages, their purposes, and the specific actions taken at each stage. However, it can be summarised as follows:

* All seeds start in a **DORMANT** state, waiting for a germination command from Tamiyo. Once germinated, they enter the **GERMINATED** state, where they are queued for training. The training phase is where the seed learns to reconstruct its input data, preparing it for integration into the host model. Once training is complete, the seed undergoes a **GRAFTING** phase, where it is integrated into the host model. This phase includes an alpha ramp, where the seed's output is gradually blended with the host model's output to ensure stability. After grafting, the seed enters the **STABILIZATION** phase, where its parameters are frozen to allow the network to settle.

* Once stabilization is complete, the seed is evaluated in the **EVALUATING** phase. If the evaluation is positive, the seed moves to the **FINE-TUNING** phase, where it is trained on the main task to align it with global goals. If the seed demonstrates global improvement, it is **FOSSILIZED**, meaning it is permanently integrated into the host model. If the seed fails at any gate, it is **CULLED**, meaning it is deactivated and removed from the system. Seeds can also be **CANCELLED** at any point by Tamiyo, resetting them back to the **DORMANT** state. This allows for flexibility in the adaptation process, enabling Tamiyo to abort adaptations that are no longer needed or that pose a risk to the host model.  

* This lifecycle is the backbone of the Esper system, ensuring that every adaptation is made with care, precision, and a focus on long-term stability. Each stage has been designed to mitigate specific risks, ensuring that the system can adapt dynamically without compromising the integrity of the host model.ycle ensures that all components share a common understanding of a seed's state, preventing race conditions and ensuring predictable behavior.

## **2.5 Controller State Management:**

## **3. Decision Logic**

Tamiyo makes the following decisions:

### The Germination Trigger

Tamiyo determines **if** and **when** the system should consider germinating *any* seed. This logic is executed at the end of every epoch.

1. **Plateau Detection**:  
   * Tamiyo maintains an internal plateau counter and tracks the prev_acc (previous epoch's validation accuracy).  
   * The plateau counter is incremented if the improvement in validation_accuracy is less than a configurable delta.  
   * The counter is reset to 0 if the improvement exceeds delta.  
2. **Trigger Conditions**: All of the following conditions must be met to proceed to Stage 2:  
   * validation_accuracy < acc_threshold: The model's performance must be below the desired target. There is no need to add capacity if the task is already solved.  
   * plateau >= patience: The performance plateau must persist for a configured number of epochs.  
   * SeedManager has at least one DORMANT seed: There must be a location available for growth.
   * No seeds are in active lifecycle states (TRAINING, GRAFTING, STABILIZATION, EVALUATING, FINE_TUNING): Ensures single-seed adaptation to prevent resource conflicts and maintain training stability.

If these conditions are met, the controller's internal state is set to "Ready to Germinate," and it proceeds to select a candidate.

### 3.2. Candidate Selection**

This stage determines **which** specific seed to germinate from all available candidates.

1. **Decision Making Data**: Tamiyo is given a compiled `model_health_map` and `seed_state_map`. Tamiyo does not poll the seed for an update; she uses only the data that has been pushed to her.
2. **Selection**: Tamiyo uses her policy and the information provided to assess if any seeds are suitable for germination based on their health metrics. This involves checking the `seed_health_map` for any dormant seeds that meet the criteria for intervention.
3. **Blueprint Selection**: Tamiyo uses her policy and the blueprint registry system to select the most appropriate blueprint for the chosen seed. This decision can be weighted using the BlueprintStrategy defined in Section 3.3.1. The blueprint selection process is designed to be autonomous, allowing Tamiyo to choose from a variety of blueprints based on the current task requirements and hardware constraints while still allowing users to priortise key outcomes. The following strategies are available:

* **Performance:** A hybrid strategy that seeks to maximize task-level performance metrics, such as validation accuracy and loss, while also considering stability. It is the default and recommended strategy for general-purpose use.
* **Stability:** Prioritizes metrics related to training stability, such as convergence and robustness. This is ideal for volatile training environments where preventing divergence is paramount.
* **Accuracy:** A focused strategy that exclusively prioritizes improving validation accuracy and reducing validation loss.
* **Risk:** A conservative strategy that only considers blueprints with a "High" confidence level (`conf_level`) and proven stability. It minimizes the chance of a failed adaptation at the potential cost of lower performance gains.
* **Novelty:** An exploratory strategy that favors new or experimental blueprints. This is useful for research and development to discover breakthrough architectures.
* **Optimization:** A comprehensive strategy for hardware-aware tuning that balances metrics for model size, inference cost, and power consumption. *This strategy will be available in a future release, as it requires extensive benchmarking data across diverse hardware platforms.*
* **Hybrid:** A flexible approach that allows for a weighted combination of multiple strategies, adapting to the current context and requirements.

### **3.3.2. Grafting Strategy Selection**

Once a seed and blueprint are selected, Tamiyo must choose the appropriate grafting strategy based on network conditions and hardware constraints. This integration with Kasmina's grafting strategy system ensures optimal growth dynamics.It is designed to be adaptive, allowing Tamiyo to select the best approach based on current conditions. It seems likely there will need to be a summary of the current state of the network, the health of the seed, and the hardware context to make this decision. The actual code for these grafting strategies will be implemented in the Kasmina operator, but Tamiyo will select which one to use based on the current context.

Grafting strategies are defined in the Kasmina high level design document.

### **3.5. Action and Output**

Once a candidate seed, blueprint, and grafting strategy are selected, Tamiyo's final action is to issue a comprehensive germination command to the Kasmina operator.

* **Action**: Call SeedManager.request_germination(blueprint_id: str, grafting_strategy: str) with the selected seed location, blueprint specification, and grafting strategy.
* **Output**: The method returns a boolean indicating whether the germination request was successful, which signals to the main training loop that the optimizer may need to be rebuilt to include the new parameters.

### **3.6 Closing the Reinforcement Loop: Field Reports**

A critical function of the Esper platform is its ability to learn from its actions. Tamiyo is responsible for closing this "Outer Reinforcement Loop" by reporting the real-world outcomes of adaptations back to the `Karn` architect. This feedback serves as a powerful reinforcement signal, allowing Karn to refine its generative process and favor architectural patterns that succeed in specific contexts.

**Trigger and Process:**

1. **Lifecycle Completion:** Tamiyo generates a `FieldReport` whenever a `KasminaSeed` completes its adaptation lifecycle by entering a terminal state: `FOSSILIZED` (success) or `CULLED` (failure).

2. **Data Aggregation:** As the central controller, Tamiyo has access to all the necessary information to construct a comprehensive report. It aggregates:
    * The unique `blueprint_id` and `seed_id` of the adaptation.
    * The global performance metric (e.g., `validation_accuracy`) both before the adaptation began (`pre_metric`) and after the `EVALUATING` or `FINE-TUNING` stage (`post_metric`).
    * The final `Outcome`, which is mapped directly from the seed's terminal state (`FOSSILIZED` -> `SUCCESS`, `CULLED` -> `FAILURE`).
    * Key performance indicators gathered during the seed's lifecycle, such as the `max_latency` and `avg_memory` observed during evaluation, and the `gradient_variance` from the training phase.

3. **Transmission to Karn:** Once aggregated, Tamiyo serializes the data into the `FieldReport` message format specified in Karn's API contract. It then transmits this report to the Karn subsystem. The target interface is the `StreamFieldReports` RPC, allowing for efficient, batched feedback.

This reporting mechanism is the cornerstone of the platform's long-term evolution, transforming Esper from a merely adaptive system into a genuinely self-improving one.

In addition to terminal lifecycle states, a `FieldReport` is also generated following an emergency rollback. If `Tamiyo` detects a catastrophic stability breach (e.g., the change in validation loss exceeds the `emergency_rollback_threshold`), it will command the active seed to a `ROLLED_BACK` state and signal the `Tolaria` trainer to restore the last checkpoint. Following this restoration, Tamiyo generates a `FieldReport` with the `Outcome` explicitly set to `ROLLBACK`.

### **"3.7 Epoch-Synchronized Lifecycle Management**
  
To ensure system stability and prevent inconsistent state reporting, `Tamiyo` is responsible for orchestrating all major lifecycle transitions for active `KasminaSeed` modules. A seed does not transition its own state upon completing a task (e.g., finishing the `GRAFTING` alpha ramp). Instead, it sets an internal flag indicating its readiness for the next stage.

During its `step()` call at the end of each epoch, `Tamiyo` receives a report from each active seed. If a seed reports it is ready to advance and global system metrics are acceptable, `Tamiyo` will issue a direct command to that seed to transition to the next state (e.g., `seed.enter_stabilization()`). This ensures all major state changes occur deterministically at the epoch boundary.

## **4. The Neural Controller**

Tamiyo will be trained neural network as follows:

* **Input Vector**: The input to the NN will be a flattened vector containing all the telemetry signals currently used by the heuristics (global metrics + health signals from all seed slots).  
* **Output**: The output will be a probability distribution over all DORMANT seeds, indicating the network's belief about which seed is the best candidate for germination.  
* **Training**: The NN will be trained using reinforcement learning or imitation learning, potentially via the "Micro-Curriculum" approach outlined in the original Morphogenetic Architectures.docx, where it learns from the successes and failures of germination in a large population of small, synthetic experiments.  
* **Seed Blueprint Library**: A key extension will be to allow Tamiyo to choose *what* to grow. The output will be expanded to not only select a seed_id but also an architecture_id from a pre-defined library of seed blueprints (e.g., "small residual MLP," "attention head adapter," etc.).
* **BlueprintStrategy**: The NN will be constrained by the user-defined blueprint_selection_strategy (see Section 3.3.1), which will guide the selection of blueprints based on the current task requirements and hardware constraints.

## **5. Progressive Curriculum System**

Tamiyo's development follows a structured 7-stage curriculum that progressively introduces complexity across task domains, hardware constraints, and safety requirements. Each stage builds upon previous capabilities while introducing new challenges.

    return (
        metrics['accuracy'] >= stage_config.target_accuracy and
        safety['rollback_rate'] >= 0.98 and
        safety['drift'] <= stage_config.max_drift and
        hardware['latency_ms'] <= hardware['max_latency'] and
        safety['security_violations'] == 0
    )
```

from torch import nn

class Blueprint(nn.Module, ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all Tamiyo blueprint modules."""
    
    def __init__(self, blueprint_id: str, input_dim: int, **kwargs):
        super().__init__()
        self.blueprint_id = blueprint_id
        self.input_dim = input_dim
        self.use_case = "generic"
        self.hardware_requirements = {}
        
    @abstractmethod
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Forward pass through the blueprint."""

    @abstractmethod
    def get_latency_estimate(self, hardware_context: 'HardwareContext') -> float:
        """Estimate latency in milliseconds for given hardware."""
        pass
```

### **6.3. Blueprint Registry**

The registry provides dynamic blueprint discovery and instantiation:

```python
class BlueprintRegistry:
    """Registry for blueprint discovery and instantiation."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._blueprints: Dict[str, Type[Blueprint]] = {}
        self._metadata: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
    
    def register(self, blueprint_id: str, blueprint_class: Type[Blueprint], 
                metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        """Register a blueprint with optional metadata."""
        self._blueprints[blueprint_id] = blueprint_class
        self._metadata[blueprint_id] = metadata or {}
    
    def create(self, blueprint_id: str, input_dim: int, **kwargs) -> Blueprint:
        """Instantiate a blueprint by ID."""
        if blueprint_id not in self._blueprints:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown blueprint: {blueprint_id}")
        
        blueprint_class = self._blueprints[blueprint_id]
        return blueprint_class(blueprint_id, input_dim, **kwargs)
    
    def get_compatible_blueprints(self, 
                                hardware_context: 'HardwareContext',
                                constraints: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[str]:
        """

        Args:
            hardware_context: Current hardware environment
            constraints: Dictionary including hardware and task constraints.
                        Examples:

        """
        compatible = []
        for blueprint_id, metadata in self._metadata.items():
            if self._is_compatible(metadata, hardware_context, constraints):
                compatible.append(blueprint_id)
        return compatible
```

## **7. Safety Shield Implementation**

This system is the concrete implementation of the first layer of the platform-wide **Operational Safety Framework**—the deterministic "Shield". Its purpose is to act as a fast, heuristic-based gate, vetoing any proposed adaptation that violates a set of hard, pre-defined constraints. The `SafetyValidator` is the core component of this Shield, enforcing the rules defined in a given `SafetyConfig` profile before a blueprint is ever passed to Kasmina for germination.

### **7.1. Safety Categories**

**Performance Safety:**

* **Drift Detection**: Monitor weight drift via cosine similarity
* **Rollback Capability**: Automatic reversion when performance degrades
* **Stability Monitoring**: Track training stability and convergence

**Security Safety:**

* **Encryption Enforcement**: Ensure data encryption in medical/financial domains
* **Privacy Preservation**: Protect sensitive information in multimodal tasks
* **Access Control**: Validate permissions for critical operations

### **7.2. Shield Configuration**

The `SafetyConfig` dataclass defines the specific rules and thresholds for the Shield. Different profiles (e.g., `DEVELOPMENT_CONFIG`, `MEDICAL_CONFIG`) can be loaded to adjust the strictness of the Shield based on the deployment environment.

```python
@dataclass
class SafetyConfig:
  """Configuration for the deterministic Safety Shield."""
  # Risk Tolerance: The highest conf_level from Urza to allow.
  # e.g., in a production environment, this might be ["High", "Moderate"], rejecting "Speculative".
  allowed_conf_levels: list[str] = field(default_factory=lambda: ["High", "Moderate", "Speculative"])

  # Performance safety
  max_drift_threshold: float = 0.15
  min_rollback_success_rate: float = 0.98
  stability_window_epochs: int = 10

  # Security safety
  encryption_required: bool = False
  privacy_mode: bool = False
  audit_logging: bool = True

  # Emergency protocols
  emergency_rollback_enabled: bool = True
  fail_safe_mode: bool = False
  max_consecutive_failures: int = 3
```

### **7.3. Shield Validation Logic**

The `SafetyValidator` is the engine of the Shield. It consumes the `SafetyConfig` and the blueprint's metadata to make an instant pass/fail decision.

```python
class SafetyValidator:
    """Implements the deterministic Shield to validate adaptations before germination."""
def __init__(self, config: SafetyConfig):
    self.config = config
    self.violation_history: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []

def validate_blueprint_deployment(self,
                                blueprint_metadata: Dict[str, Any],
                                hardware_context: HardwareContext,
                                current_metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """
    Validate that a proposed blueprint deployment passes all deterministic Shield checks.
     Args:
        blueprint_metadata: The full metadata stub for the candidate blueprint from the Urza library.
        ...
    """
    violations = []

    # Check 1: Risk and Confidence Level
    conf_level = blueprint_metadata.get('conf_level')
    if conf_level not in self.config.allowed_conf_levels:
        violations.append(f"Blueprint conf_level '{conf_level}' is not in allowed list: {self.config.allowed_conf_levels}")

    # Check 2: Hardware & Resource Constraints (as before)
    # ... (existing checks for power, latency, etc.)

    # Check 3: Drift and Stability Constraints (as before)
    # ... (existing checks for drift)

    # Check 4: Security Requirements (as before)
    # ... (existing checks for encryption)

    is_safe = len(violations) == 0
    if not is_safe:
        self.violation_history.append({"blueprint": blueprint_metadata.get('signature'), "violations": violations})

    return is_safe, violations
```

## **8. Unified Configuration System**

Tamiyo uses a unified configuration system that aligns with KASMINA and KARN components, ensuring consistent behavior across the morphogenetic ecosystem.

### **8.1. TamiyoConfig Structure**

```python
@dataclass
class TamiyoConfig:
    """Unified configuration for Tamiyo v2.0 with full ecosystem alignment."""
    
    # Performance thresholds (aligned with Kasmina)
    acc_threshold: float = 0.95
    plateau_patience: int = 5

### **8.2. Configuration Integration Points**

The unified configuration ensures consistent behavior across components:

* **Kasmina Integration**: Seed lifecycle states and grafting strategies align with KASMINA's operational model
* **Karn Integration**: Blueprint selection criteria incorporate KARN's performance feedback and status normalization
* **Urza Integration**: Blueprint metadata and lineage tracking are consistent with Urza's library management
* **Safety System**: Configuration parameters feed into safety validation and constraint checking

## Appendix A: Detailed Blueprint Selection Strategies

Blueprint Strategies steer Tamiyo's decision-making process when selecting which blueprint to use for germination. These strategies can be configured based on the specific requirements of the task, hardware constraints, and safety considerations. The following strategies are available:
Performance: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes model performance metrics. It is a hybrid of the Staiblity, Accuracy, and Risk strategies.

* Stability: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes stability metrics, such as convergence and robustness.
  * A ccuracy: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes accuracy metrics, such as validation loss and accuracy.
  * Risk: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes low risk blueprints, such as those with proven stability or low failure rates.
  * Novelty: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes novel or experimental blueprints, which may not have been extensively tested but offer potential for significant performance improvements. This strategy is useful for exploring new architectures or techniques that could lead to breakthroughs in performance or efficiency.

* Optimization: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes optimization metrics. It is a hybrid of the Size, Cost, Power and Performance blueprints # This strategy requires that Tamiyo is trained on a diverse range of platforms and Size, Cost, Power and Performance metrics are available. As such, these will not be available in the initial release.
  * Size: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes the size of the model, such as the number of parameters or memory usage. # Requires Size Metrics
  * Cost: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes cost metrics, such as energy consumption or resource utilization. # Requires Cost Metrics
  * Power: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes power consumption metrics, such as energy efficiency or thermal output. # Requires Power Metrics
  * Performance: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes hardware performance metrics, such as throughput or latency. # Requires Performance Metrics

* Safety: The blueprint selection strategy that prioritizes safety metrics, such as drift detection or rollback success rate. # Requires Safety Metrics
* Hybrid: The blueprint selection strategy that combines multiple strategies to balance performance, stability, and safety. It is a flexible approach that adapts to the current context and requirements.

Tamiyo will be trained and tested using a diverse range of tasks and strategies, to ensure that she can adapt to different contexts and requirements. The initial release will focus on the Performance, Stability, Accuracy, and Risk strategies, with the other strategies being added in future releases.
