# Esper

**Esper Morphogenetic Training Platform** - A neural network morphogenesis system enabling runtime adaptation through Just-in-Time compilation of computational graphs into optimized GPU kernels.

## Overview

Esper implements the Kasmina Operator Subsystem, which serves as the foundational execution layer for neural network adaptation. The system transforms theoretical BlueprintIR representations into high-performance executable code while maintaining strict safety guarantees and production-grade reliability.

## Key Features

- **Cache-First Architecture**: >99% cache hit ratio with <1ms lookup times
- **JIT Compilation**: Quality-first compilation with extensive optimization
- **Safety by Design**: Multiple validation layers and graceful degradation
- **GPU-Resident State**: Vectorized execution with minimal CPU overhead

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- CUDA-capable GPU (for training/inference)
- PyTorch 2.1+
- Triton 2.0+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/esper.git

- [x] BlueprintIR with complete metadata
- [x] IRNodeType enum with Tier 1 primitives
- [x] Unit tests for data structure validation

**Week 2 Status**: ðŸš§ In Progress

- [ ] Shape inference pipeline - âœ… Implemented  
- [ ] Canonical hashing for caching - âœ… Implemented
- [ ] Serialization/deserialization - âœ… Implemented
- [ ] Integration tests for graph manipulation

## Architecture

The Kasmina Operator Subsystem consists of three main planes:

1. **Compilation Plane**: BlueprintIR processing and kernel generation
2. **Caching Plane**: High-performance kernel registry and persistence
3. **Execution Plane**: GPU-resident state management and vectorized execution

### Development Philosophy

- **Fail Hard**: Better to fail with clear errors than hide bugs
- **Explicit is Better**: No magic or implicit behaviors
- **Quality Over Speed**: Extensive optimization during compilation
- **Zero Tolerance**: No training corruption events
